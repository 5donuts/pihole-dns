  # Reduce EDNS reassembly buffer size.
  # IP fragmentation is unreliable on the Internet today, and can cause
  # transmission failures when large DNS messages are sent via UDP. Even
  # when fragmentation does work, it may not be secure; it is theoretically
  # possible to spoof parts of a fragmented DNS message, without easy
  # detection at the receiving end. Recently, there was an excellent study
  # >>> Defragmenting DNS - Determining the optimal maximum UDP response size for DNS <<<
  # by Axel Koolhaas, and Tjeerd Slokker (https://indico.dns-oarc.net/event/36/contributions/776/)
  # in collaboration with NLnet Labs explored DNS using real world data from the
  # the RIPE Atlas probes and the researchers suggested different values for
  # IPv4 and IPv6 and in different scenarios. They advise that servers should
  # be configured to limit DNS messages sent over UDP to a size that will not
  # trigger fragmentation on typical network links. DNS servers can switch
  # from UDP to TCP when a DNS response is too big to fit in this limited
  # buffer size. This value has also been suggested in DNS Flag Day 2020.
