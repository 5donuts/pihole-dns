# From the PiHole docs:
# IP fragmentation is unreliable on the Internet today, and can cause
# transmission failures when large DNS messages are sent via UDP. Even
# when fragmentation does work, it may not be secure; it is theoretically
# possible to spoof parts of a fragmented DNS message, without easy
# detection at the receiving end. Recently, there was an excellent study
# >>> Defragmenting DNS - Determining the optimal maximum UDP response size for DNS <<<
# by Axel Koolhaas, and Tjeerd Slokker (https://indico.dns-oarc.net/event/36/contributions/776/)
# in collaboration with NLnet Labs explored DNS using real world data from the
# the RIPE Atlas probes and the researchers suggested different values for
# IPv4 and IPv6 and in different scenarios. They advise that servers should
# be configured to limit DNS messages sent over UDP to a size that will not
# trigger fragmentation on typical network links. DNS servers can switch
# from UDP to TCP when a DNS response is too big to fit in this limited
# buffer size. This value has also been suggested in DNS Flag Day 2020.
