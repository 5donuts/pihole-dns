# I pulled these from the /etc/pihole/setupVars.conf generated using a
# manual pihole install, so I'm sure there are more options you can set.

# DNS settings
dns:
  # The DNS servers to forward non-blocked requests to
  upstream_servers:
    - "{{ unbound_interface }}#{{ unbound_port }}" # Use the local unbound DNS server

  # This is the "Never forward non-FQDN A and AAAA queries" option in the web UI.
  # When there is a Pi-hole domain set and this option is set, this asks FTL that this
  # domain is purely local and FTL may answer queries from /etc/hosts or DHCP leases
  # but should never forward queries on that domain to any upstream servers. If
  # Conditional Forwarding is enabled, unsetting this option may cause a partial DNS
  # loop under certain circumstances (e.g. if a client would send TLD DNSSEC queries).
  never_forward_non_fqdn: yes

  # This is the "Never forward reverse lookups for private IP ranges" option in the web UI.
  # All reverse lookups for private IP ranges (i.e., 192.168.0.x/24, etc.) which are not
  # found in /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases are answered with "no such domain" rather than
  # being forwarded upstream. The set of prefixes affected is the list given in RFC6303.
  # Important: Enabling this and `never_forward_non_fqdn` may increase your privacy, but may
  # also prevent you from being able to access local hostnames if the Pi-hole is not used as
  # the DHCP server.
  never_forward_private_rev_lookups: yes

  # This is the "Use DNSSEC" option in the web UI.
  # Validate DNS replies and cache DNSSEC data. When forwarding DNS queries, Pi-hole requests
  # the DNSSEC records needed to validate the replies. If a domain fails validation or the
  # upstream does not support DNSSEC, this setting can cause issues resolving domains. Use an
  # upstream DNS server which supports DNSSEC when activating DNSSEC. Note that the size of
  # your log might increase significantly when enabling DNSSEC.
  use_dnssec: yes

  # These options correspond to the "Conditional Fowarding" section in the web UI.
  # If not configured as your DHCP server, Pi-hole typically won't be able to determine the names
  # of devices on your local network. As a result, tables such as Top Clients will only show IP
  # addresses. One solution for this is to configure Pi-hole to forward these requests to your
  # DHCP server (most likely your router), but only for devices on your home network.
  # Enabling Conditional Forwarding will also forward all hostnames (i.e., non-FQDNs) to the
  # router when "Never forward non-FQDNs" is not enabled.
