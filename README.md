# PiHole DNS

**An Ansible playbook to configure a PiHole DNS server.**

I used to use a modified version of [geerlingguy/internet-pi](https://github.com/geerlingguy/internet-pi) but want different things from my Pi than that project provides.

## Components

**PiHole**: Install and configure [PiHole](pi-hole.net) to do network-wide DNS blackholing of ads.

**Unbound**: Install and configure [Unbound](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) as a recursive DNS server.
Unbound has a number of features that help increase your online privacy, especially when compared to using Google DNS (8.8.8.8) as your upstream DNS provider for PiHole including DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS.

## Setup

1. Install Ansible
2. `git clone git@github.com:5donuts/pihole-dns.git`
3. `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`
4. Modify `inventory.ini` to match your setup (i.e., set your Pi's IP address or configure a local connection)
5. `cp config.defaults.yml config.yml`, then modify `config.yml` to suit your needs (i.e., change the Pi password, enable & disable components)
6. `cp inventory.example.ini inventory.ini`, then modify `inventory.ini` to suit your needs (e.g., set the actual IP address of the Pi on your network, configure connection variables)
7. `ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini main.yml`
